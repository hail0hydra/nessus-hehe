# Usage
`docker run -itd --name=ramisec_nessus -p 8834:8834 ramisec/nessus`  ~~(497MB Only!!!)~~ (It takes 885MB now because of adding openjdk8)

That's right, easy like that! But it need update the plugins with the following command. 🤣  

# Update
`docker exec -it ramisec_nessus /nessus/update.sh "UPDATE_URL_YOU_GOT"`  
The **UPDATE_URL_YOU_GOT** you need to apply in nessus [website](https://tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials) to get **an activation-code**, and generate it in this [website](https://plugins.nessus.org/v2/offline.php)  
For example:

<img width="544" alt="image" src="https://github.com/elliot-bia/nessus/assets/40572216/0a821a76-060c-4b51-a1a4-f95bd56e2556">  

Any stings like `aaaaaa11b2222cc33d44e5f6666a777b8cc99912` would be available, but remeber must not be the same :)  

And you will get the **UPDATE_URL_YOU_GOT**

__Alert__  
If you CAN NOT update successful, please CHECK the network connection!

# Readme

This crack was originally used, and I didn't plan to make it public  
But when I used the FAHAI cracked version of AWVS yesterday, I saw such a sentence:  
`Thank's Fahai && Open Source ENTHUSIAST`  
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40572216/174698816-440d4969-f9d6-4c7d-982c-9af9c4a3e875.png" width = "400" height = "200" alt="图片名称" align=center />

So I was thinking, I used so many open source projects, how many contributions did I make?  
I simply disclose this project, which can also be considered a little contribution to the Internet security  
If there is no accident, it will continue to be updated, after all, I also need to use  
~~Don't get the automatic update plug -in version, use it first!~~  
I had release auto-update version, check Update log!

The Original Intention of the Project is in the Spirit of Open Source  
We can do a little thing for open source, for the world!

__Big update：auto-update plugins version has release！__

usage： `docker run -itd --name=ramisec_nessus -p 8834:8834 ramisec/nessus`  
The container had no plugins, it need to update by following command:  
`docker exec -it ramisec_nessus /bin/bash /nessus/update.sh`  
and it can be update again next time by the same command ！



## v2 20220621

Update the latest version of 20220620, and use 2 versions of NESSUS/JESSUSLITE  
The former has been cracked and compiled the plug -in.  
The latter needs to wait a few minutes to compile the plug -in

In fact, there is another EASY way to solved the encryption, try and find it!😆
